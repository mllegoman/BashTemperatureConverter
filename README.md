# BashTemperatureConverter
Fahrenheit/Celsius converter for bash

I don't know how to format README'S so I apologize in advance

A versatile temperature converter for the native GNU language bash
-Can take inputs in practically any format (i.e: 32F, 0C, 212f, 100c, F212, C100, 32 f, 0 c...)
-usage goes a little something like this: sh /path/to/the/file/T $numerical_value F
-output should appear as "numerical_value C" and vice versa for Celsius conversions

# Enjoy!
